# AmberFD

Full documentation (work in progress) for all the methods, arguments, and tools available
in AmberFD can be found in it's separate [documentation page](https://christopheramyers.github.io/AmberFD_Documentation/html/index.html)

This package incorporates a Fluctuating Density based model for MD simulations performed with OpenMM.
Similar to a fluctuating charge model, this model incorporates explicit polarization into a simulation by
adjusting the density sites at each time step so that the electrostatic energy is minimized. Additionally, 
The forces incorporated here uses atom centered monopole densities, described by Slater functions for the 
electrons and point-particles for the nuclei, to incorporate effects of electron overlap between atomic sites.

This model replaces the nonbonded interactions for RNA nucleobases only. Everything else that is simulated in
an OpenMM system remains the same. In order to construct a simple, traditional openmm simulation, one may
write a simple python script as follows (from their user guide: http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application/02_running_sims.html)

```Python
from openmm.app import *
from openmm import *
from openmm.unit import *
from sys import stdout

pdb = PDBFile('input.pdb')
forcefield = ForceField('amber14-all.xml', 'amber14/tip3pfb.xml')
system = forcefield.createSystem(pdb.topology, nonbondedMethod=PME,
        nonbondedCutoff=1*nanometer, constraints=HBonds)
integrator = LangevinMiddleIntegrator(300*kelvin, 1/picosecond, 0.004*picoseconds)
simulation = Simulation(pdb.topology, system, integrator)
simulation.context.setPositions(pdb.positions)
simulation.minimizeEnergy()
simulation.reporters.append(PDBReporter('output.pdb', 1000))
simulation.reporters.append(StateDataReporter(stdout, 1000, step=True,
        potentialEnergy=True, temperature=True))
simulation.step(10000)
```

To enabme AmberFD forces, a similar python script can be use with very minor adjustments:

```Python
from openmm.app import *
from openmm import *
from openmm.unit import *
from sys import stdout
from AmberFD.AmberFD import MoleculeImporter, AmberFDSimulation

### AmberFD Handles forcefield assignment and importing structres
pdb = MoleculeImporter('input.pdb', ('AmberFD.xml', 'amber14/tip3pfb.xml'), onbondedMethod=PME,
        nonbondedCutoff=1*nanometer, constraints=HBonds) 
integrator = LangevinMiddleIntegrator(300*kelvin, 1/picosecond, 0.004*picoseconds)
simulation = AmberFDSimulation(pdb.topology, system, integrator)   ### Similar to Simulation(), but enables AmberFD forces 
simulation.context.setPositions(pdb.positions)
simulation.minimizeEnergy()
simulation.reporters.append(PDBReporter('output.pdb', 1000))
simulation.reporters.append(StateDataReporter(stdout, 1000, step=True,
        potentialEnergy=True, temperature=True))
simulation.step(10000)
```

# Installation
## Requirements
AmberFD has been tested using the following libraries and packages:

<ul>
        <li> CMake 3.16.4
        <li> g++ 7.5.0
        <li> Python 3.9.0
        <li> LAPACK 3.9.0
        <li> OpenMP 4.5
        <li> SWIG 4.0.1
</ul>
                
AmberFD does the heavy lifting as a compiled C++ Library, while the API is mostly designed to be used for Python. A majority of this Python code is autogenerated using SWIG. Additionally, fluctuating density forces are parallelized with OpenMP, but it's performance has only been moderately benchmarked.

## compilation
First, in a console, change to the directory that you downloaded AmberFD
```
$ cd <AmberFD_Folder>
```
Next, create a directory called ```build``` to compile the libraries in, and change to that directory
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
Call CMake to perform the precompilation checks to make sure you have all the required packages
```
$ cmake ../
```
If this passes, you can then procede to compile the code. Simply type
```
$ make
```
Finally, make sure that everything was put together as it should,
```
$ make test
```

For the meantime, there is no install step (working on it!). In your python code, either install the generated \_AmberFD.py and libAmberFD.a library yourself in a convienient location, or add
```Python
sys.path.insert(1, '/path/to/AmberFD/build/')
```
to your Python import statements.
